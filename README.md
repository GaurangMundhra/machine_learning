## About

This repository contains code and resources for learning, implementing, and experimenting with machine learning. It may include supervised and unsupervised algorithms, deep learning experiments, and utilities for data processing and visualization.

## Features

- Example implementations of machine learning models
- Data preprocessing and visualization utilities
- Notebooks and scripts for experiments
- Usage of libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and more
- Modular code and clear documentation

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GaurangMundhra/machine_learning.git
   cd machine_learning
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Browse the code in the repository for examples and experiments.
- Run Jupyter notebooks using:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Execute scripts directly:
  ```bash
  python script_name.py
  ```
- Modify existing code or add new models as needed!
